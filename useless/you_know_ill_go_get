You know I'll go get you, yeah
Whatever it takes to get there
Know I won't drop you
Like everybody else does
Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go
If we do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been lookin' for you forever baby
We go together baby, we go, we go
In this crazy world of choices, I know we got a few
Either you're comin' with me, or I'm comin' with you
'Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl, I've been lookin' for you
And when I saw you, I knew
That I'd finally found, I'd finally found you
